### A tad bit about who I am

I am an avid lover of technology and especially the web. I like to follow the bleeding edge web
technologies to see where the industry is heading, while keeping my personal workflow modern, but
stable and efficient. You'll often catch me playing around with one-off projects to test out new and
different technologies. Learning is a passion and endless pursuit. I've chosen to focus that passion
on the ever evolving world of the web.

When I'm not spending my time on the computer I'm on the backroads, zipping around on two wheels.
The outdoors is a great place to relax and decompress, whether it be on a trail on the side of a
mountain or laxily laying on the beach. There is no shortage of time that I enjoy spending under the
sun.
