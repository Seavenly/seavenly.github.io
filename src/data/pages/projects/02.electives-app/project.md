        description:
          The JavaScript application fills elective slots for middle school students, based on various criteria such as student's grade, submission time, available elective slots, quarter offered, and more. Students fill out a form, which generates a CSV file after the deadline date. The CSV file is then used to run the program and populate electives with students.
